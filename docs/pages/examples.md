Protocol: TLS

Security: weak
TLS Version(s): TLS1.0, TLS1.1
Vulnerabilities:
  - Medium - While Triple-DES is still recognized as a secure symmetric-key encryption, a more and more standardizations bodies and projects decide to deprecate this algorithm. Though not broken, it has been proven to suffer from several vulnerabilities in the past (see [sweet32.info](https://sweet32.info)).
  - Medium - In 2013, researchers demonstrated a timing attack against several TLS implementations using the CBC encryption algorithm (see [isg.rhul.ac.uk](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/Lucky13.html)). Additionally, the CBC mode is vulnerable to plain-text attacks in TLS 1.0, SSL 3.0 and lower. A fix has been introduced with TLS 1.2 in form of the GCM mode which is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack. GCM should be preferred over CBC.
  - Medium - The Secure Hash Algorithm 1 has been proven to be insecure as of 2017 (see [shattered.io](https://shattered.io)).

### Update

The CLI is working with an offline database (Marshaled Ruby hash) to avoid
fetching and parsing all source file at each execution.
If you want up to date values but do not want to wait for an official new
release of TLS map you can use the update command.
Doing so you will override `data/mapping.marshal` but for security purpose
and integrity check is done so if the file is modified the tool will refuse to
word so you have to use the `--force` option every time to bypass the security
check. So it is recommended to not use the update command and wait for official
release.

## Library

Basic usage, searching for cipher name equivalent in other libraries.

```ruby
require 'tls_map'

tm = TLSmap::App.new

# Translate from one lib to another
tm.search(:gnutls, 'RSA_ARCFOUR_128_SHA1', :iana) #=> {:iana=>"TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA"}
tm.search(:openssl, 'AES128-SHA', :iana) #=> {:iana=>"TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA"}
tm.search(:iana, 'TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA', :codepoint) #=> {:codepoint=>"0037"}

# Get all
tm.search(:codepoint, '1303') #=> {:codepoint=>"1303", :iana=>"TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256", :openssl=>"TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256", :gnutls=>"CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256", :nss=>"TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"}
tm.search(:nss, 'TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384') #=> {:codepoint=>"1302", :iana=>"TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384", :openssl=>"TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384", :gnutls=>"AES_256_GCM_SHA384", :nss=>"TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"}
```

Usage of the `Extended` class to get advanced information about a cipher
(online feature).

```ruby
require 'tls_map'

# tm = TLSmap::CLI.new # (Offline)
tm = TLSmap::App.new # (Online)

# Translate from one lib to another
cipher = tm.search(:gnutls, 'RSA_ARCFOUR_128_SHA1', :iana)
# => {:iana=>"TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA"}

tmext = TLSmap::App::Extended.new
